# About

The directory contains anonymized Internet traces from CAIDA, and some analyses
of the trace files.


## Data Source

CAIDA’s data set constitutes traces collected from high-speed monitors on a commercial backbone link.


## Layout

The directory `common` hosts the scripts and artifacts that are commonly used in
the analyzing the different trace files. The trace files and analyses output are
stored in separate directories, with each named using the trace file metadata.
The directory `2019-0117-1300-A`, for instance, contains the data and analyses
for the trace file generated on January 17, 2019 at 1300 hours (from the link in
direction “A”).
